# Twent-Sevens        


	To play, imagine a game of Noughts & Crosses in a 3d space.
	The 3d space is represented in 3 game boards, the left most
	board (board 1) representing the bottom level, and the right
	most board (board 3)representing the top level.
	
	board 1    board 2    board 3
	
	| | | |    | | | |    | | | |
	| | | |    | | | |    | | | |
	| | | |    | | | |    | | | |
	
	Combos of 3 can be made between levels or on a single level,
	but you may only play on board 2 or 3, if the corresponding square
	has been filled on the previous board.
	
	Unlike Noughts & Crosses, the game does not end when a combo is
	made. Instead, the player is awarded points for the combo
	and the game continues until every square has been filled or
	one of the players resigns.
	
	Points are awarded as such: 
	
	multi-level combo  = 2 points
	single-level combo = 3 points
	
	Examples:
	
	3 x's are stacked on top of each other; this is considered 
	a "multi-level combo" and is awarded 2 points. 
    	
	|x| | |     |x| | |    |x| | |
	| | | |     | | | |    | | | |
	| | | |     | | | |    | | | | = 2 points
	
	3 o's are placed in a flat row; this is considered
	a "single-level combo" and is awarded 3 points.

	|o| | |     | | | |    | | | |
	|o| | |     | | | |    | | | |
	|o| | |     | | | |    | | | | = 3 points
	
	
	THIS IS AN ILLEGAL MOVE AS THE CROSSES ON BOARD 2 AND 3 CAN
	NOT BE STACKED ON TOP OF EMPTY SQUARES.
	
	|X| | |     | |X| |    | | |X|
	| | | |     | | | |    | | | |
	| | | |     | | | |    | | | |
	
		3 x's are stacked diagonally from bottom left to top
	right; this is considered a "multi-level combo" and 
	is awarded 2 points. 

	|x|o|o|     | |x|o|    | | |x|
	| | | |     | | | |    | | | |
	| | | |     | | | |    | | | | = 2 points
	
	The game is played best when each player tally's their own score as they make
	combos. A good house rule is that if you fail to notice a combo before your
	next turn, then you miss out on the points. Either way, tallying up points
	at the end of the game is not recommended.
